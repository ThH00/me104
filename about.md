## Ed Discussion
For homework advice or conceptual questions, please use EdDiscussion. Class group chats besides Ed are not allowed. If you have non-conceptional or non-homework/exam related questions, please use email.

Ed Discussion etiquette:
1. Ask HW questions only in HW posts.\
We’ve created individual posts for each problem from homework. Please ask questions, discuss problems, or help out in those
posts only. Before asking a question, read through (or search) the whole post to see if your question has been answered.
2. Don’t post answers on ed.\
Please don’t give away the answer on ed. You can explain things in a way that still lets other students figure out the
essence of the problem on their own, but don’t spoil the problem.
3. Try to make posts public.\
While not violating Rule 2, try to make your questions public, because others might have the same question and we don’t
need to answer them multiple times.
4. ed is not OH. 5 minute-test.\
If you think your questions may take more than 5 minutes to answer, please come to oﬃce hours.
5. ed is not for pre-grading.\
Please do not use Piazza as a medium to ask instructors to check your homework in advance. We simply cannot check every
student’s homework through Piazza.
6. Post a screen shot of any resource referenced.\
Your question should be self-contained. The responders should not have to scan through PDFs to even figure out what the
question is. Ask yourself: am I referring to some lecture note/HW solution/discussion solution/past exam?
If the answer is yes, post a screen shot of the relevant part.

## Grading

| Item | Percentage |
| ---- | ---------- |
| In class quizzes | 24% |
| Homework | 6% |
| Midterm I | 20% |
| Midterm II | 20% |
| Final | 30% |

If, at the end of the semester, you submit evaluations for both the instructor and the GSI, we will retain only your 12 highest in-class quiz grades (so that each counted quiz contributes 2% to your final grade). This policy is intended to accommodate any potential absences during the semester. Please use this policy only as a last resort.

In accordance with departmental guidelines, the mean GPA for the course will be approximately 2.9. In-class quiz solutions and exam solutions will be posted on the class website.

## In class quizzes
In this class, my goal is for you to get plenty of practice during lectures. To encourage this, each lecture will include either a group or individual assessment.

## Homework
Each week, you will have one take-home homework assignment that involves some coding. These assignments are designed to help you deeply understand and apply the concepts we cover in class. You’ll submit them on Gradescope by midnight on the due date.

## Problem Sets
For each concept we cover, I will post a corresponding problem set. We will solve some of these problems in class, some during discussion sessions, and others will have video solutions. The remaining problems you are expected to work through on your own. You are always welcome to ask about any of these problems during office hours or on Ed.

## Study Group
You are encouraged to form small study groups of 2-3 students. However, each student should write their homework on their own.
Do not share homework solutions!

## Text, Reader, and Supplemental Material
All of the lectures will be taken from Professor O’Reilly’s book

O. M. O’Reilly, Engineering Dynamics: A Primer, Third Edition
Springer-Verlag, New York, 2019.

The electronic version of this text is available for free [here](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-11745-0). You will need to install the [UC Berkeley Library Proxy](https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/help/proxy-server) to be able to
view the book from oﬀ-campus.

Problem set problems will be assigned from

J. L. Meriam, L. G. Kraige, and J. N. Bolton Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics, Ninth Edition, Wiley, New York, 2018.

You can use any version of this textbook as an extra reference. I will post the prompt of the questions you need to solve.

## Lecture Recordings
I will arrange for the lecture to be recorded. However, the recordings might not be setup by the first week of class.

## Copyrights
All the course material, including but not limited to homework sets, homework solutions, quizzes, exams, lecture notes, lecture
videos, discussion notes, discussion videos, etc. are under copyright. No part can be copied transmitted (e.g. Chegg, course hero,
etc.), reproduced or translated into another language without the written permission of Theresa Honein.

## Honor Code
As a member of the UC Berkeley community, you are expected to act with honesty, integrity, and respect to others. Any test
submitted by you should be your own work done without collaboration or contact with anyone and without consulting any online
resources. You are allowed to discuss the homework with other students, but you are required to prepare and submit your own
written work. You are not allowed to consult any solution manuals or websites/apps such as Chegg. Honor code violations will be
punished.

## Active Learning
Check out these two excellent videos of Professor Noel Perkins from the Univesity of Michigan at Ann Arbor explaining the active learning techniques he uses to teach dynamics! [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHEys-JHeb8), [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96j69u4v-wE). We will using these techniques ourselves.
